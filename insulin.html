  <h1>  Insulin Pricing In America </h1>
    <div>

  Why is Insulin Pricing Important?
  <div>
    More than one-third of Americans have a potentially deadly disease and don’t even know it. According to the Center for Disease Control, more than 100 million people in the United States are prediabetic or have diabetes. Diabetes mellitus, commonly called diabetes, is a chronic illness defined as suffering from high blood sugar levels over an extended period of time. Type One, or juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a person’s body does not produce insulin, the hormone that signals to the liver to take in glucose. In Type Two diabetes, the receptors that insulin usually binds to in the liver are resistant. For millions of people around the world suffering from diabetes, having insulin means the difference between life and death. Without insulin, a diabetic has too much glucose in their bloodstream, a condition known as hyperglycemia. In extreme cases, the body cannot access sugar and begins to break down fat into energy, and ketones are released into the body. When there are too many ketones in a person’s bloodstream, it turns the blood into acidic and leads to diabetic ketoacidosis. Without medical intervention, DKA can lead to diabetic coma or death. Fortunately, in the 21st century, people have the resources and ability to make diabetes a lot less dangerous. A balanced diet, exercise, and most importantly, insulin keep diabetics alive and healthy. However, due to rising drug prices and inadequate health care coverage, too many Americans with diabetes cannot afford the very medication they need to live. But injury and death from lack of insulin are a reality that is easily avoided. Lowering the too-high price on insulin would give millions of diabetics access to their medication, and quite possibly save their life.

    People Have Already Died:
    <div>
      Death from lack of insulin is not some faraway dystopia. Alec Smith was 26 years old when he died from insulin rationing. Alec was a type 1 diabetic and needed to inject insulin daily to survive. When he turned 26, Alec was no longer able to be on his parents’ insurance plan and did not have adequate health insurance. He needed to pay out of pocket for insulin and supplies. But at $1,300 dollars per month, Alec simply couldn’t afford to use his costly insulin whenever he needed it. He began using insulin sparingly, rather than on the necessary daily basis. On June 27th, 2017 Alec was found dead in his apartment after falling into a diabetic coma, less than a month after he turned 26. Alec is not the only one. Since 2017, at least six people have been reported to have died while they were desperately trying to make insulin last longer. Meaghan Carter died because she couldn’t afford to pay $800 a month for her insulin after losing her job and health insurance. Instead, she used cheaper but less effective insulin. She died at age 47 from diabetic ketoacidosis. Micah Fischer aged out of his father’s insurance plan, and couldn’t afford the $1,200 that Humalog (his prescribed brand of insulin) cost. He died two weeks before his new insurance plan would’ve started paying for Humalog. Jesse Lutgen resorted to rationing his insulin after he lost his job. He died on February 7, 2018. Antavia Lee Worsham couldn’t afford $1,000 a month after aging out of state-sponsored insurance. She resorted to borrowing and rationing insulin. She died from diabetic ketoacidosis. Shane Patrick Boyle moved to Arkansas from Texas to take care of his ailing mother and couldn’t afford insulin without the help of his community. He created a GoFundMe page to sponsor his medication and died on March 18th, 2017, with the fundraiser only $50 short of his goal. Six people. Six diabetics. Six individuals who couldn’t afford crucial medication. Six preventable deaths.

    A History of Artificial Insulin:
    <div>
    In January 1922, a patient received an insulin injection for the first time. After a successful clinical trial, the Canadian scientists Frederick Banting and Charles Best sold their patent for one dollar to the University of Toronto, which then sold it to pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. The doctors who formulated insulin sold it so cheaply because they intended for it to be used for the public good. Unfortunately, the eventual purchasers of the insulin formula had other plans. Namely, profit.  Thousands of years of advancements in medicine and technology led up to this moment in history. Humans have a treatment for diabetes, once an immediate death sentence up until the 1920’s when insulin was discovered. The magic potion to prevent a diabetic coma or ketoacidosis exists, and we have the recipe. And yet, it is increasingly unattainable for those who struggle financially. People are rationing their insulin because they can’t afford more, and are dying from the consequences. Banting and Best foresaw how powerful their invention of biosynthetic insulin was, and gave it to a university so that everyone could benefit. But ninety-six years later, insulin is used as the paramount example of a corrupt medical system designed to line pockets, even at the cost of lining coffins. 
<p>
    The Big Three:
    <div>
    Today, Eli Lilly is still one of the biggest manufacturers of insulin. Together with medical drug conglomerates Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, Eli Lilly controls 90% of the insulin world market. Almost 100 years later, how can a trio of companies still control the market? In America, patents on medications generally last around 20 years, meaning biosimilar medications cannot be created by competing brands for 20 years. The only thing between Sanofi and an insulin monopoly are its co-conspirators, Eli Lilly and Novolog. Suspiciously, the prices of all three companies would rise dramatically and simultaneously. A 2017 lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court accused Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, and Sanofi of price-fixing, or illegally creating an agreement between competing businesses to maintain or raise prices. Regardless of whether or not a conspiracy is afoot, the exponential increase in pricing is calling unwanted attention to insulin producers. Sanofi’s CEO was called to testify in front of Congress about skyrocketing costs, and President Trump said pharmaceutical companies were “getting away with murder,”. Trying to associate their names with something positive, insulin manufacturers are offering their products at a discounted, but still substantial cost. Eli Lilly has announced plans to sell “Lispro,” their popular Humalog insulin with a different name and half the price tag, while Novo Nordisk committed to keep their prices to less than a 10% increase in a single year. Drug manufacturers are finally listening to the people and making an effort, but it’s too little too late. 

<p>
    A Purely American Issue:
    <div>
    Everyone has a right to live, but very few American diabetics can afford to. Between 2002 and 2013, the price of insulin tripled. Then, in the five year period between 2014 and 2019, the cost of insulin more than doubled. In 1996, the price of insulin was around $32, adjusted for inflation. In 2019, insulin can be more than $500 per month. American diabetics are alone among first world countries in enduring the indignity and financial woes of abnormally high insulin prices. Popular rapid-acting insulin, Humalog costs an average $13.47 per milliliter out of pocket in America, but only $3.16 in Canada, and it is free in Portugal, France, and Italy. Competitor Novolog has out of pocket costs of $9.20 per milliliter in America, but only 60 cents per milliliter in Australia, 11 cents per milliliter in Germany, and has no out of pocket costs in Bulgaria, Chile, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Diabetic care in the United States costs 7.6% of the average American’s monthly income. Meanwhile, people who live in England have access to cheaper medication, and on average spend only 1.4% of monthly income on diabetic equipment. 

    Because of unaffordable pricing, diabetics are looking internationally to buy their medication, sometimes illegally. Deidre Waxman is a 66-year-old diabetic and lives in Newton, Massachusetts. Deidre’s Medicare would cover diabetic costs up to $3,700 per year, leaving her to pay the remaining $12,000 out of pocket. Six years after her initial diagnosis, Deidre’s insulin comes solely from Canadian pharmacies. A once-a-year six-hour drive and her husband’s frequent business trips provide more than enough insulin for Deidre; the extras are placed in styrofoam containers with ice packs and shipped to needy friends. For those who can’t drive to Canada, Canada can come to them. The Marks Marine Pharmacy in Vancouver proudly displays on their homepage, “Yes, we can ship insulin!”. Canshipinsulin.com, the pharmacy’s page dedicated to insulin medication, requires a prescription, payment and $25 to ship across the border. Three weeks later, brand name insulin shows up on an American doorstep for a fraction of the price. While relying on Canadian insulin is a useful precaution, it is not a sustainable option for people who can’t wait almost a month for US Customs to approve their insulin shipment. Canada is proof that America can do better, and until it does, there is the very real and grim possibility that more and more people will cross the border in hopes of better healthcare and being able to afford life-saving medication. 
<p>
    Progress:
    <div>
    Fortunately, there have been some policy steps being made to contain the soaring prices. The first major breakthrough in the fight against insulin pricing just happened. On May 22, 2019, Colorado became the first state to place a price cap on insulin. Under the new law, diabetics will only have to pay a maximum of $100 per month out of pocket for insulin, regardless of the amounts used. Insurance company Cigna introduced a program that caps monthly cost of insulin at $25 and will be open to all Americans with diabetes by next year. America has a blood sugar issue, and drug companies aren’t letting it be treated. For a country that claims “life” is an “unalienable right,” It is a moral imperative to allow life to be universally available, not just for the rich, by making insulin affordable again.
